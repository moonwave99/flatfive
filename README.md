# FlatFive

Hear and remember the harmony ideas you write down.

```
Esus2
Am6
C#11
B7aug5
Em9
```

Set duration, voicing and articulation for the chord.

## Musical roadmap

- add lead sheet view;
- set voicing (shell / drops / manual);
- split voices over 2 staves;
- add basic comping (bossa, swing, house, etc);
- allow some patterns (bossa, popped, etc);
- allow custom written voicings.

## Technical roadmap

- add zustand;
- persist sketches in localstorage;
- settle for a serialisation format.
